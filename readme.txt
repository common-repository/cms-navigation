Out-of-the-box support for full CMS navigation in your WordPress site including drop down menus, breadcrumbs trail and sidebar navigation.

== Description ==

*Update*: **Our new plugin, [WPML](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sitepress-multilingual-cms/stats/ "WPML Multilingual CMS"), includes the functionality of *CMS Navigation* and is recommended for new designs.**

It features much cleaner and simpler HTML and customization via the admin screen.
Check out the [migration instructions](http://wpml.org/wordpress-cms-plugins/cms-navigation-plugin/migrating-from-cms-navigation-to-sitepress/) from *CMS Navigation* to *WPML*.

Do you want to use WordPress to create a full website, with easy navigation and menus?
This plugin will let you add essential navigation functions to your template, including:

 * Top navigation bar, listing the top-level pages and their children (as drop-down items).
 * Breadcrumbs trail navigation that shows the path to the current page all the way from the home page.
 * Left navigation that shows where the visitor is next to the page's parent and nearby pages.

No configuration is required. To use, add the calls that create each navigation element to your template.
These calls can be added to any WP template

There are three template functions that can be used for displaying the navigation sections
 
= Drop down top menu =
Function:
`cms_navigation_menu_nav($order='menu_order', $show_cat_menu=false, $catmenu_title='News')`
 
This will display the top navigation - the top level pages with their sub pages as drop down elements.
Additionally - if specified - the menu will include the top level post categories at the end.

Normally, this function is added to your header.php file, so that it applies to the entire website.
 
Examples:

 * `<?php cms_navigation_menu_nav() ?>` - include without the categories menu.
 * `<?php cms_navigation_menu_nav('post_title') ?>` - sort items by title.
 * `<?php cms_navigation_menu_nav('menu_order',true,'News') ?>` - sort items according to the 'order' field.
 
= Breadcrumbs trail navigation =
Function:
`cms_navigation_breadcrumb()`
 
This will display a path from the current page all the way to the home page.
It's useful for visitors who land in your website to know where they are and be able to navigate to relevant pages.

__For posts__

`Home >> CATEGORY-NAME >> Post title`

__For pages__

`Home >> Parent pages... >> Page title`

All the items back to the home page will be clickable.

You can add this function to single.php and page.php so that it will produce trail navigation for every page or post.

= Sidebar navigation = 
Function:
`cms_navigation_page_navigation($order='menu_order')`
 
This will display the sidebar navigation for pages.
It will show a tree created the page parents and it's 'brother' pages (other children to the same parent).

This function should be added to page.php, as it provides local navigation between pages.

= Live example using this plugin =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work with any theme? =

You can add the navigation functions that the plugin creates to any theme. As a demo, we've added it to the WordPress Default theme.

= Where can I find detailed instructions =

Click on the plugin page. It shows detailed instructions of what PHP code needs to be added and where.

= How do I customize the drop down menus and other stuff? =

There are a `css` and `img` folders in the plugin install folder. Don't edit them.
Instead, you can provide your own CSS in your theme which will override these defaults. If you edit the plugin files, your edits will be lost when you upgrade the plugin.
